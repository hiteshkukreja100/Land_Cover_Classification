# Land_Cover_Classification

This project is a land cover classification tool developed to classify drone or satellite images into five classes: building, land, road, vegetation, and water. It also predicts the number of trees in the image. It features a user-friendly UI built using Streamlit.

## Overview

Land cover classification is an essential task in remote sensing and environmental monitoring. This project aims to provide a convenient tool for classifying aerial images into distinct land cover categories. Users can upload drone or satellite images through the UI, and the model will automatically segment the image into the following classes:

- Building
- Land
- Road
- Vegetation
- Water

Additionally, the model predicts the number of trees present in the image.

## Usage

To use the land cover classification tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/hiteshkukreja100/Land-Cover-Classification.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py


4. Access the app through your web browser and follow the on-screen instructions to upload an image and view the classification results.
